## Ch. 20: Text Processing

The next set of tools are another great resource.

Don't forget you can use the PDF to copy/paste larger chunks of data...In this case, it takes some regex playing to make it work, so I have put a copy of the distros.txt file in `/ufrc/bsc4452/share/Class_Files/TLCL_files/`.

* p. 276: **MS-DOS Text vs. Unix Text**: Especially for Windows users this is an important box to read. DOS (the underlying OS of Windows) and Linux do not use the same characters to signify the end of a line. Many text editors on Windows default to DOS line breaks. If you then transfer a file with DOS line breaks to Linux, the file is often interpreted as one long line and this usually breaks things! VSCode, always uses Linux line breaks. But the `cat -A` command featured here is handy.

{% include callout.html content="To convert a file with DOS line breaks to Linux, you can use the `dos2unix`: e.g. `dos2unix file.txt`. There is a file in the Class_Files folder with DOS line breaks:
<br><br>
    [magitz@login3 ~]$ cat -A /blue/bsc4452/share/Class_Files/data/DOS_formatted_file.txt<br>
    This is an example DOS text file.^M$<br>

* p. 277: **`sort`**: We have seen the `sort` command before. This section points out some of the many options that `sort` has.
* p. 280: **`sort`**: This section on sort introduces the idea of thinking of a data table as consisting of rows of *records* and columns of *fields*. 
* p. 280: **`sort`**: The `distros.txt` file can be found at `/blue/bsc4452/share/Class_Files/TLCL_files/distros.txt`. Lots of great examples of playing with data in this section!

{% include tip.html content="You may notice that the text starts with a basic command like `cut -f 4 distros.txt` and then adds another transformation, or changes an option to get a slightly different output. This iterative process, starting simple and refining to achieve a desired result is an excellent strategy when approaching a problem. A command line the one on 290--`sort -k 3.7nbr -k 3.1nbr -k 3.4nbr distros.txt > dis
tros-by-date.txt`--is not written fully formed, fully functional from the start; it is the product of testing, modifying, refining. Do not expect to write such commands from scratch, do not believe that the author did either!" %}

* p. 290 & 291: **`paste`** and **`join`**: `paste` can be useful, but keep in mind that the order of records in the files must be the same! `join` however can be used to combine files that have a shared column of data. We will look at joins more when we get to databases. Have a look at this section, but don't worry too much about the details.

* p. 293 - 298: **Comparing Text**: You can skip the rest of the chapter. The `diff` command can be useful, but there's too much to learn here...

* p. 298: **Editing on the Fly**: `tr` can be useful, so have a quick look at this section. `sed` is super powerful, this is a quick introduction. `sed` allows you to do regular expression find and replace like operations from the command line. I would suggest looking at this section, but focus on the substitution options: e.g. `s/first/second/g`. The text has a ton of great examples, and maybe one of them speaks to you, but I think it may be overwhelming!

* p. 309: **`aspell`**: skip this section.
