GitHub does a decent job of rendering static versions of notebooks on the web, but one neat thing about notebooks is that they remain fully interactive. I encourage you to clone the repository, load the Jupyter notebooks and play with the code."

    "* p. 20: **2.2 Variables**: Notice the difference between how variables are referenced in Bash and Python. In Bash, we assigned a value with something like `x=7` and the referenced the variable with something like `echo $x`--adding the `$` before the variable name. Most programming languages use some character, often the `$`, before variable names to help differentiate other text from variables. Python is different in that it does not use any special characters. As we will see, this can create other problems. A good text editor with syntax coloring will help you out here too!\n"

    "\n",
    "The oposite of implicit typing is **explicit typing** where you, as the coder, must declare--when you define the variable--what type of data it will hold. C, C++ and others rely on explicit typing--this tends to be the case for compiled programs as the machine code needs to be compiled to properly store the data before the data are present. This forces coders to be more explicit about what they plan to do with a variable, but can also be limiting when you might want to not be explicit ahead of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit typing is handy for programmers because you don't need to think about what type of data the variable will hold...except that you kind of do, because different types do different things when you operate on them."
