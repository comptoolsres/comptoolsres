## What is Git

Git is a tool for version tracking that has become increasingly popular among coders for facilitating not only version tracking, but also collaboration and code distribution.

You do not need to have Git installed on your own computer, but you may want to. It is freely available from: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

## What is github.com

{% include image.html file='github_logo.jpg' alt="github.com social coding logo" position="right" max-width=200 %}[github.com](https://github.com) is a service that allows you to host git repositories (sets of files being tracked by git) on a publicly accessible website, further promoting collaboration, sharing, and code distribution. Many applications, data, and more are distributed via github.com and we will use github.com to explore using git for version control and collaboration. Indeed, the page you are reading now is part of a git repository hosted at github.com!   


## Register for your github.com account

* Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign-up for an account--please use your @ufl.edu email address when signing up. This will allow you to get an academic account.

  {% include note.html content="github.com frequently updates their pricing model. **By using your UF email and registering for GitHub Education (see below) you will gain free access to GitHub Copilot**, an AI pair programmer. We will use this a fair bit in the course, so I encourage you to do this.<br><br>If you already have an account, but used a non-UF email, you can update your email [here](https://github.com/settings/emails)<br><br>
  Non-UF students can use whatever email is best for them" %} 


  {% include tip.html content="You should never need to pay anything or enter any credit card information for anything in this course!" %}

* Complete any email verification GitHub sends to you.

## Register for GitHub Education

* **This is optional, but give you free access to the GitHub Copilot among other things**: To add the educational upgrade to a pro account, you can go to [https://education.github.com](https://education.github.com) and follow the steps to request an educational discount.

## The assignment

 {% include tip.html content="**Why do I need this assignment?** We will use GitHub a lot in this course. I need to know your GitHub username to add you to the group that can launch GitHub Codespaces in the course organization. GitHub provides a limited number of minutes for free for the course, so I need to limit who can launch Codespaces to make sure we have enough resources as we get started." %}


* For this assignment, we will use github classroom. Click on this link to access the assignment: [https://classroom.github.com/a/oiWbMVZq](https://classroom.github.com/a/oiWbMVZq) (**This link is for the Fall 2024 semester of the course at UF**)

* **Authorize GitHub Classroom to access your account.**

   {% include image.html file='git_authorize.png' alt="Screenshot of authorizing github classroom to access account" position="center" max-width=350 %}

* **Click the "Accept this assignment" button** (note that the assignment is called "GitHub Registration" this year vs the screenshot that says "register" in green).
