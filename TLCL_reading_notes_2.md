# Notes on TLCL Ch 7 & 8

## Ch 7: Seeing the World as the Shell Sees It

* This chapter covers a lot. It is definitely worth reading and doing your best to understand, but can get a little on the overly detailed side.
* p. 71: Arithmetic Expansion: One thing that this section should point out to you is that, while you *can* do math with bash, it is not the easiest thing! Especially with more complex calculations, bash quickly becomes more trouble than it is worth and it is far easier to switch to Python or other language with better math functionality.
* p. 75: Backquotes: The text uses the term "backquote" for the "`" character (usually the key to the left of the 1 on your keyboard), this character is also referred to as the "backtick".


## Ch 8: Advanced Keyboard Tricks

* This chapter can certainly improve your skills and make it easier to do things, but I would not spend time worrying trying to memorize these. It is helpful to know that the options exist, and find and remember the ones you find helpful, but memorizing these is not the goal.
* p. 83: Completion: Tab completion is definitely worth learning, you will use it all the time!
* p. 85: Using History: While history is maintained on HiPerGator and is very useful, please be aware that because you can be logged in on multiple servers, sometimes things get lost in the history. It will generally be there and can be used, but don't rely on exclusively. Keep notes of useful commands, etc.
