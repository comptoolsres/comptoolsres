## About the site

This site has been developed as the main repository for Matt Gitzendanner's Computational Tools for Research in Biology. This course is typically offered every fall at the [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu), with Matt teaching in even numbered years and Ed Braun teaching in odd years. This site serves both as the primary resource when teaching the course, and as a resource for others teaching similar courses or learning on their own.

The course was designed to be a one semester, 3-credit course for upper-level undergraduate and starting graduate students.

The main branch is intended for the current, or most recent offering and there are also branches for previous offerings of the class. Some links in the older branches may no longer work.
