This site has been developed as the main repository for Matt Gitzendanner's Computational Tools for Research in Biology. This course is typically offered every-other-year at the [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu). This site serves both as the primary resource when teaching the course, and as a resource for others teaching similar courses or learning on their own.

The course was designed to be a one semester, 3-credit course for upper-level undergraduate and starting graduate students.

There are branches for previous instances of the class, including [Summer A 2020](https://github.com/comptoolsres/comptoolsres.github.io/tree/Summer2020). Some links in the branches may no longer work.
