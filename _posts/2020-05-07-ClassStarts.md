Hi All,

Class starts on Monday, May 11, 2020 at 11:00am.

Here is the information from the welcome email registered and auditing students should have received today:

Hi everyone

This is Matt Gitzendanner, the professor for BSC4452 and BOT6935, Computational Tools for Research. The class will begin at 11:00 a.m. on Monday, May 11. Zoom information is located in Canvas, but here is the link for the class meetings (M,W,F 11:00-12:15): 

Zoom information redacted, email Matt for details.

I encourage you to log into Canvas, but the main course website (which is the syllabus) is at: https://comptoolsres.github.io/

It would be great to go ahead and download the free textbooks (or order print copies if you want them) and install the software before class starts on Monday. Summer A is a fast-paced semester and we will jump right in.

If you have trouble logging into the e-Learning system, contact the HelpDesk: helpdesk@ufl.edu or call (352) 392-4357 (352-392-HELP).

I look forward to seeing you all on Monday!

Sincerely,  
Matt Gitzendanner
