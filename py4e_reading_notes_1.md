Chuck Severance, the author of [Python for Everybody: Exploring Data Using Python 3](https://www.py4e.com/book.php) states in his preface:
> Few of my students were planning to be professional
computer programmers. Instead, they planned to be librarians, managers, lawyers, biologists, economists, etc., who happened to want to skillfully use technology in their chosen field.

As far as I am aware, this also applies to most of my students, which is part of why I like this text.

Further, in Chapter 1, Chuck state:
>This book assumes that everyone needs to know how to program, and that once you know how to program you will figure out what you want to do with your newfound skills.

I'm sold! I hope you enjoy this text as much as I do!

## Some General Python Notes

### Python 2 vs Python 3

Python 2 was released in 2000 and became quite popular. Python 3 was released in 2008, with a few changes that broke a fair bit of Python 2 code. For example python3 requires parentheses around print statements (generally equivalent to the bash `echo` command)
```python 
Python 2: print "Hello World!"
Python 3: print ("Hello World!")
```

Because of these changes, people have resisted switching to Python 3. There is still a lot of code that is Python 2 and still people writing in Python 2.

Some of the new features of Python 3 we so good, Python 2 holdouts even made a "future" module and they do things like:

`from __future__ import print_function`

But the world moves on and it is a decade later! Python 2 was initially set to "end of life" in 2015, but it wasn't until January 1, 2020 that [support was officially ended](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/) and what is supposed to be *THE FINAL* version of python 2, 2.7.18, was released April 20, 2020.

But you do need to know that 
* we'll use Python 3,
* pay attention when Googling for help and 
* you may run into Python 2 code.

### Python on HiPerGator

On HiPerGator, we install maintain several version of Python for users. There is a version that comes with the operating system, and that is what is used unless you load a module for the version you want. In general, even if you don't care too much about the version, load a python module, because these are where most user requested Python modules are added. As an example:

```bash
[magitz@login2 ~]$ which python
/usr/bin/python
[magitz@login2 ~]$ python --version
Python 2.7.5
[magitz@login2 ~]$ module load python
[magitz@login2 ~]$ python --version
Python 3.7.6
[magitz@login2 ~]$
```

### The Shebang line (#!) in scripts

Remember the shebang line for bash scripts?

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
```

We need the same thing for Python scripts. Many sources on the internet will tell you to do:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
```

But that means the script will always be run with `/usr/bin/python` even if that isn't the Python you want or Python isn't installed there. 

So use:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
```

`/usr/bin/env` is a program to look in the environment path and check for `python` in this case. This is more portable and allows Python to be installed wherever in the user's path.

### Ways to use Python

Maybe even more so than Bash, there are a number of ways to use Python.
With Bash, we started with running commands on the command line on HiPerGator and built up to writing scripts.

#### Interactive Python Prompt:

Python has an interactive command prompt, like Bash:

```bash
[magitz@login3 share]$ module load python3
[magitz@login3 share]$ python3
Python 3.6.5 (default, Apr 10 2018, 00:31:24) 
[GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-16)] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

And you can start working in Python there. The Py4E text does a lot at the command prompt. Personally, I don't find that terribly useful.

#### Python Scripts

As with Bash we can put Python commands in a text file and execute the script:
```bash
[magitz@login3 Examples]$ pwd
/ufrc/bsc4452/share/Class_Files/Examples
[magitz@login3 Examples]$ cat HelloWorld.py 
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# This is a simple script to print some text

print ("Hello World!!")

[magitz@login3 Examples]$ module load python
[magitz@login3 Examples]$ python HelloWorld.py 
Hello World!!
[magitz@login3 Examples]$ 
```

This is what I do most of the time, but requires going back and forth between editing a file and running that file. It does have the advantages of being fairly easy to run on the cluster and requiring little setup.

#### Editing scripts in VSCode

Similar to Bash scripts, Python scripts are plain text files. Any text editor can be used to write Python scripts. But VSCode (and others) have a number of added benefits that are worth checking out.
We've already looked at contextual coloring, which VSCode does for many languages, including Bash. Clearly easier to read and catch errors than plain text.

Good text editors also have code suggestions and function information popups that help you write your code. They have linters to check your syntax and note errors. And are configurable for how you want to code.

#### Jupyter Notebooks

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is web application that creates documents that have live code, visualizations and descriptive text formatted with markdown (used in most of these pages).

Jupyter can be run on HiPerGator by going to [jhub.rc.ufl.edu](https://jhub.rc.ufl.edu/) (You do need to be on the UF network)


## Ch 1 Why should you learn to write programs?

* p. 6: **1.5 Conversing with Python**: We will be using Python on HiPerGator. To get to the Python command prompt, login, load the python module and type python:

    ```bash
    [magitz@login3 ~]$ module load python
    [magitz@login3 ~]$ python
    Python 3.7.6 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Mar 23 2020, 23:03:20)
    [GCC 7.3.0] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>
    ```

* p. 16: **1.14 Exercises**: I do not assign the exercises, but do encourage you to think about and try some of them. They area good way to test yourself and build more fluency with the content of the chapters.
