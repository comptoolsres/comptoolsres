## About this site

This site is the being developed as the main repository for Matt Gitzendanner's Computational Tools for Research in Biology. This course is typically offered every-other-year at the [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu). My hope is that this site can serve both as the primary resource when teaching the course, and as a resource for others teaching similar courses or learning on their own.

The course was designed to be a one semester, in-person, 3-credit course for upper-level undergraduate and starting graduate students. During Summer 2020, I am offering it as an online course with some modifications.

## Course Description

{% include image.html file='comptools.png' alt="Image of servers and tool icons" position="right" %}

Information technology has dramatically transformed how research across many disciplines is conducted. This is particularly true in the biological sciences where researchers frequently find themselves faced with massive amounts of diverse data to analyze. As data types and volumes continue to grow, knowledge of scripting, database management, and advanced computing skills are critical for researchers.

Topics covered in the course will address a gap in how research has advanced—*and become increasingly computational*— while student training in the use of computational tools has lagged. The course assumes no prior coding or command line skills, and covers concepts that will provide the ability for students to apply new technologies to a wide array of research questions. A foundation in data management and analysis concepts opens doors for well-trained scientists and allows them to work in multidisciplinary research.

This course will survey areas where high performance computing, large-scale data access and integration, informatics tools and software, and multi-disciplinary collaboration have had high impact on research as a foundation for computationally-enabled research.

{% include note.html content="While the title of the course includes 'in Biology' there is little that is actually focussed on biology. This course strives to be broadly applicable to many areas of research. Bureaucracies being what they are, the title is what it is..." %}

## Course Organization

The course is divided into three main sections:

* Section 1
  * Linux command line
  * Bash scripting
  * Version control
  * Using high-performance computing resources

* Section 2
  * Python scripting

## Meeting Times

Summer A runs May 11, 2020 through June 19, 2020. May 25th is Memorial Day holiday.

### Synchronous Meetings: Mon, Wed, Fri 11:00am - 12:15pm

* I will be online and presenting material and/or helping students: **Mon, Wed, Fri during 3rd period (11:00am - 12:15pm)**
{% include important.html content="You should make every effort to attend these sessions. While there will be note pages and hopefully a video recording of these sessions, **this is the best opportunity to ask questions and get help from me and others in the class.**" %}
  * I understand that with all that is going on, some students will need to miss classes sometimes. That is fine and I will do my best to help you catch up, but regular attendance is the best way to learn.

### Asynchronous Work: Tue, Thurs

* On Tuesday and Thursday, students will work on projects either independently or in small, virtual groups.
* These sessions can be more flexible in timing and will give you and your classmates times to get more hands-on experience and challenge yourselves to learn on your own.
* There will still be content that needs to be covered, and students should plan on working on Tuesday and Thursday, but can generally do the work whenever is convenient for them.

### Office Hours: Thursday 11:00 to 2:00 and by Appointment

* I have scheduled office hours for **Thursday between 11:00am and 2:00pm**. I am also available at other times by appointment.
{% include tip.html content="Coding is not always easy. Simple solutions are not always obvious. There will be some frustration. I expect that you will need help. You should expect that you will need help. I want to help you! I cannot always help if you don't ask. Please ask for help." %}

## Course Policies

### Class Attendance and Makeup Policy

Requirements for class attendance and makeup assignments, and other work in this course are consistent with university policies that can be found in the online catalog at: [https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/attendance-policies/](https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/attendance-policies/)

### Quiz and Assignment Policy

Quiz and assignment dates will be announced at least one week in advance and students will have at least one week to complete the quiz or assignment. Each quiz or assignment will clearly state if it is an individual or group assignment.  Individual assignments must be the student’s own work, completed without the assistance of others.

All quizzes and assignments are "open book, open internet", you may use whatever resources you desire to complete the quiz/assignment. Though only assignments specifically noted as group assignments should be worked on with other people.

### Makeup and Late policy

Please notify the instructor of circumstances that lead to late work or missed classes. I will generally work with you and accept late work. Without prior notification, late work will be penalized 5% per day after the due date.

## Students Requiring Accommodations

Students with disabilities requesting accommodations should first register with the Disability Resource Center (352-392-8565, [https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/](https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/)) by providing appropriate documentation. Once registered, students will receive an accommodation letter which must be presented to the instructor when requesting accommodation. Students with disabilities should follow this procedure as early as possible in the semester.

## Course Evaluation

Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing course evaluations online via GatorEvals. Guidance on how to give feedback in a professional and respectful manner is available at [gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/). Students will be notified when the evaluation period opens, and can complete evaluations through the email they receive from GatorEvals, in their Canvas course menu under GatorEvals, or via [ufl.bluera.com/ufl/](https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl/). Summaries of course evaluation results are available to students at [gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/).

## Class Demeanor and Netiquette

Students are expected to arrive to class on time and behave in a manner that is respectful to the instructor and to fellow students. Please avoid the use of cell phones and restrict eating to outside of the classroom. Opinions held by other students should be respected in discussion, and conversations that do not contribute to the discussion should be held at minimum, if at all.

### Cell Phone and Texting Policy

Students should turn cell phones to vibrate before coming to class. Cell phone rings and notifications disrupt fellow students and the instructor. Please be courteous to all and silence your phone.

### Computer Use

This is a hands-on computational class and students are expected to have their computer at every class. Students should be working on course content while in class. Students are expected to be respectful of others with the content visible on their computers. Sometimes videos are a helpful way to learn new content. If that is the case, please use headphones so that the audio is not audible to others in class.

### Discussion Boards

The Canvas discussion boards can be used to ask for and provide help by all. Students should be supportive and considerate of others at all times. Rude or inappropriate comments will be removed and the poster will be warned.

## University Honesty Policy

UF students are bound by The Honor Pledge which states:
>We, the members of the University of Florida community, pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honor and integrity by abiding by the Honor Code. On all work submitted for credit by students at the University of Florida, the following pledge is either required or implied: “On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment.”
