## BSC4452 and BSC6451 Registration information for Fall 2024

* **BSC 4452**: Class 19032 {% include image.html file='comptools.png' alt="Image of servers and tool icons" position="right" %}
* **BSC 6451**: Class 22340

## Course Description

The early 2000's where characterized as the era of *Big Data*, with researchers across disciplines finding research transformed by large volumes of diverse data. In the past decade, this has been again transformed by the re-emergence of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems aiding in interpretation of Big Data. As data types and volumes continue to grow, knowledge of scripting, database management, and advanced computing skills, including AI fundamentals, are critical for researchers regardless of discipline.

This course introduces students to the tools needed to be proficient, computationally-enabled researchers, providing a foundation in Linux and Bash scripting for data management, Python coding, basic SQL database fundamentals, and an introduction to artificial intelligence methods.

**The course assumes no prior coding or command line skills**, and covers concepts that will provide the ability for students to apply new technologies to a wide array of research questions. A foundation in data management and analysis concepts opens doors for well-trained researchers and allows them to work in multidisciplinary fields.

{% include note.html content="While the title of the course includes '*in Biology*' there is little that is actually focussed on biology. This course strives to be broadly applicable to many areas of research. Bureaucracies being what they are, the title is what it is..." %}

## Course Organization

The course is divided into four main sections:

* Section 1
  * Linux command line
  * Bash scripting
  * Version control using Git and GitHub
  * Using high-performance computing resources

## Meeting Times

### Synchronous Meetings

* Mon, Wed, Fri 9:35 AM - 10:25 AM (Period 3)
* Bartram Hall, room 211 and on Zoom

{% include image.html file='lecture.png' alt="lecture icon" position="right" max-width=75 %}

  {% include important.html content="You should make every effort to attend these sessions synchronously. While I will post most lectures ahead of time and will record these session, **this is the best opportunity to ask questions and get help from me and others in the class.**" %}

* I understand that some students will need to miss classes sometimes. That is fine and I will do my best to help you catch up, but regular attendance is the best way to learn.

### Asynchronous Work

* Students will work on projects either independently or in small, groups.
* This work can be more flexible in timing and will give you and your classmates times to get more hands-on experience and challenge yourselves to learn on your own.

### Student Help Time

{% include image.html file='office_hours.png' alt="Office Hours icon" position="right" max-width=75 %}

* Mondays from 11:00 am to noon, Physics (NPB 2334) or on Zoom

## Course Policies

### Class Attendance and Makeup Policy

Requirements for class attendance and makeup assignments, and other work in this course are consistent with university policies that can be found in the online catalog at: [https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/attendance-policies/](https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/attendance-policies/)

In general, I do not take attendance. You are all adults and I assume you are taking the class the learn. The best way to learn is to regularly attend class. I am sure students will miss class for various reasons. I am happy to help you catch up. If you regularly miss class and fall behind, I may ask that you hold questions on content you have missed until after class, or ask that you coordinate a time to go over the content. I will make every effort to record and post all classes to help those that miss classes.

### Quiz and Assignment Policy

Quiz and assignment dates will be announced at least one week in advance and students will have at least three days to complete the quiz or assignment. Each quiz or assignment will clearly state if it is an individual or group assignment.  Individual assignments must be the student’s own work, completed without the assistance of others.

All quizzes and assignments are "open book, open internet", you may use whatever resources you desire to complete the quiz/assignment. Though only assignments specifically noted as group assignments should be worked on with other people.

### Makeup and Late policy

Please notify the instructor of circumstances that lead to late work or missed classes. I will generally work with you and accept late work. Without prior notification, late work will be penalized one point per day after the due date.

In response to COVID-19, the following recommendations are in place to maintain your learning environment, to enhance the safety of our in-classroom interactions, and to further the health and safety of ourselves, our neighbors, and our loved ones.

* If you are not vaccinated, get vaccinated. Vaccines are readily available and have been demonstrated to be safe and effective against the COVID-19 virus. Visit one.uf for screening / testing and vaccination opportunities.
* If you are sick, stay home. Please call your primary care provider if you are ill and need immediate care or the UF Student Health Care Center at 352-392-1161 to be evaluated. 
* Course materials will be provided to you with an excused absence, and you will be given a reasonable amount of time to make up work.

## Students Requiring Accommodations

Students with disabilities requesting accommodations should first register with the Disability Resource Center (352-392-8565, [https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/](https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/)) by providing appropriate documentation. Once registered, students will receive an accommodation letter which must be presented to the instructor when requesting accommodation. Students with disabilities should follow this procedure as early as possible in the semester.

## Course Evaluation

Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing course evaluations online via GatorEvals. Guidance on how to give feedback in a professional and respectful manner is available at [gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/). Students will be notified when the evaluation period opens, and can complete evaluations through the email they receive from GatorEvals, in their Canvas course menu under GatorEvals, or via [ufl.bluera.com/ufl/](https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl/). Summaries of course evaluation results are available to students at [gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/).

## Class Demeanor and Netiquette

Students are expected behave in a manner that is respectful to the instructor and to fellow students. Opinions held by other students should be respected in discussion, and conversations that do not contribute to the discussion should be held at minimum, if at all.

Students should be working on course content during class.

### GitHub Discussion Board

Canvas can be a challenge when working with code. As such we will use the [GitHub discussion board](https://github.com/comptoolsres/comptoolsres.github.io/discussions) to ask for and provide help by all. Students should be supportive and considerate of others at all times. Rude or inappropriate comments will be removed and the poster will be warned.

## University Honesty Policy

UF students are bound by The Honor Pledge which states:
> We, the members of the University of Florida community, pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honor and integrity by abiding by the Honor Code. On all work submitted for credit by students at the University of Florida, the following pledge is either required or implied: “On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment.”

[The Honor Code](https://sccr.dso.ufl.edu/policies/student-honor-code-student-conduct-code/) specifies a number of behaviors that are in violation of this code and the possible sanctions. Furthermore, you are obligated to report any condition that facilitates academic misconduct to appropriate personnel. If you have any questions or concerns, please consult with the instructor or TAs in this class

## Statement Regarding Course Recording

Our class sessions may be audio visually recorded for students in the class to refer back to and for use of enrolled students who are unable to attend live. Students who participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded. If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate verbally are agreeing to have their voices recorded.  If you are unwilling to consent to have your voice recorded during class, you will need to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the "chat" feature, which allows students to type questions and comments live. The chat will not be recorded or shared. As in all courses, unauthorized recording and unauthorized sharing of recorded materials is prohibited.
