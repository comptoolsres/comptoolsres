## General tutorials

* [![carpentries logo](images/TheCarpentries.png)](https://carpentries.org/) Much like this course, [The Carpentries'](https://carpentries.org/) mission is "to teach foundational computational and data science skills to researchers." All of their lessons are posted and free to use. I highly recommend checking out the resources available at [carpentries.org](https://carpentries.org/).
